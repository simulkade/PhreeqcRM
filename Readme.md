# Compiled PhreeqcRM
I have compiled it using the Cmake and Visual Studio 2015. The source of PhreeqcRM comes from [USGS](https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/). This is PhreeqcRM 3.5.0.  

You will most probably need [Visual C++ Redistributable for VC 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) to use the Windows library. The Linux version of the library should work out of the box. There are convenient [Matlab](https://github.com/simulkade/PhreeqcMatlab) and [Julia](https://github.com/simulkade/JPhreeqc.jl) wrappers for these libraries (Python is coming soon).
